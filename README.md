# 🖍️ Real-Time Grammar-Based Syntax Highlighter (Python + PyQt5)

This project is an advanced real-time syntax highlighter application, developed in Python using modern libraries like **PyQt5** and **Pygments**. It provides a responsive GUI text editor that highlights programming language syntax based on grammatical structures (not just keyword matching), enabling more accurate code visualization.

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ Real-time syntax highlighting
- 🧠 Grammar-aware parsing with Pygments
- 🖥️ Rich GUI built with PyQt5
- 📁 File open/save functionality
- 🌐 Multi-language support (initially Python, expandable to Java, C, etc.)
- 🎨 Light/dark theme options (planned)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- QSyntaxHighlighter
- Pygments
- Regex / Lark (for future parsing)
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 📌 Project Goal

To build a modular, extensible, and user-friendly real-time code editor that not only highlights syntax but also lays the foundation for integrating grammar-based linting and static analysis in the future.

## 🧠 Target Audience

- Students learning compiler design, programming languages or GUI development
- Developers who want to understand how syntax highlighting engines work
- Anyone looking to contribute to an open-source, Python-based developer tool
